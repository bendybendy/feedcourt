#Food Court

I dearly loved the wall of text aggregator [Popurls](http://popurls.com/), that is until they started messing with it, forcing in images and dropping customization. It didn't seem to hard to create a clone of my own, so that's what this project is: a dead simple web app that grabs RSS feeds and puts them on a page.
