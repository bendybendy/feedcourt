# Feed Court

I dearly loved the wall of text aggregator [Popurls](http://web.archive.org/web/20151031011257/http://popurls.com/), until they started messing with it, forcing in images and dropping customization. It didn't seem to hard to create a clone of my own, so that's what this project is: a dead simple server-side web app that grabs RSS feeds and puts them on a page. 

The index.html is generated by a cron'd python script that reads a list of rss feeds. Vanilla javascript creates an event to expand div to see more text. That's about it for now.
